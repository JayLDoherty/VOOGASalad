===========

**Written by**: Elliott Bolzan (eab91) on March 28th, 2017.

Our team is composed of the following **members**: 

- Elliott Bolzan (eab91)
- Mina Mungekar (mem94)
- Jimmy Shackford (jas199)
- Jay Doherty (jld60)
- Jesse Yue
- Kyle Finke (kwf10)
- Matthew Barbano (meb100)
- Nikita Zemlevskiy (naz7)
- Dennis Ling
- Michael Li (mxl3)

As a team, we agree to abide by these **rules** for the duration of our project:

- Be respectful of others' ideas.
- Complete your share of work.
- Follow deadlines (both those set by the group and those set by the class).
- Ask for your team mates' help if you are struggling.
- Show involvement in the project.
- Regularly consult the team's GroupMe message and your subgroup's Facebook message.
- Attend most group meetings (absences are of course excusable).

In the event that a team member consistently **does not follow** these rules, the following steps can be taken:

- The team may inquire about the reasons underlying this lack of accountability.
- The team may confront the team member about his or her behavior.
- The team may take the additional step of notifying the course's staff.

Finally, as a team, we will **strive and expect to**:

- Complete the project according to the course's specifications.
- Present a final product we are proud of, because of its functionality, design, graphic design, and ease-of-use.
